My progress in class.

<b>Exercise 1:</b> <br>
"Now, using the stuff we talked about, you can take some time to implement a simple counter with: <br>
Increment <br>
Decrement <br>
Reset <br>
<br>
What happens with the counter value when we refresh the page? How can we make it so that the value remains the same when you refresh? <br>
<br>
Adding persistence <br>
Browser's localStorage provides a way to store data, so that when the user refreshes or re-opens the webpage, the data is still there! <br>
<br>
Please note that this only works on the same browser on the same device, so if you try to open you webpage in a different browser, or on a different device, you won't see the same data. We will talk about how to solve this problem in the future ðŸ˜‰ " <br>
